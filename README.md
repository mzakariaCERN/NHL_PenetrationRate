# NHL_PenetrationRate
Relate to a project to calculate the rate of infection for Non Hodgkins Lymphoma


In this code, I will:
1. Get the data for NHL rate per state from a website (https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21590)
2. Get the data for US population by state from wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population)
3. Find ration to account for infection rate per 100k
