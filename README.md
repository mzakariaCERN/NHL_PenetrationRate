# NHL_PenetrationRate
Relate to a project to calculate the rate of infection for Non Hodgkins Lymphoma


In this code, I will:
1. Get the data for NHL rate per state from a website (mention website)
2. Get the data for US population by state from wikipedia (add link)
3. Find ration to account for infection rate per 100k
